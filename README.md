# IMDB-SwiftUI
Open Source IOS movie streaming app on IOS


IMDB-SwiftUI is an application that uses the IMDB API and is built with SwiftUI. 
 

## Architecture

I designed according to TDD and MVC.



## SwiftUI

IMDB-SwiftUI is in pure Swift UI, the goal is to see how far SwiftUI can go in its current implementation without using anything from UIKit (basically no UIView/UIViewController representable).

It'll evolve with SwiftUI, every time Apple edits existing or adds new features to the framework.

## Platforms
Currently IMDB-SwiftUI runs on iPhone, iPad, and macOS.
